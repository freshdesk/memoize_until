## 1.2.1  - 08 May, 2020

* ðŸš€ [ENHANCEMENT] Public method `clear_now_for` added to `MemoizeUntil`, delegating the method to the underlying store object. This is done to support writing unit test cases without touching getting dirty with the private `Store` API. [#8](https://github.com/freshdesk/memoize_until/pull/8). Thanks to [@ritikesh](https://github.com/ritikesh).
